I joined the organization in August 2025, and since the main project was initiated in December 2025, this period was primarily focused on onboarding, understanding the problem domain, and skill development. During this time, I worked on exploratory tasks related to the project, including extracting and structuring data from PPT files using Python libraries such as python-pptx and docling. I also experimented with different prompt strategies and integrated the extracted data with language models to improve output accuracy and coherence. This phase helped me build a strong foundation, and I am now well-prepared to take on more substantial responsibilities and contribute more actively going forward.
