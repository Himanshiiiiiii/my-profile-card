Rogo.ai uses large language models (LLMs) from major AI providers and custom-trained models in its platform, tailored specifically for financial workflows:
🔹 Core Models Integrated
OpenAI’s GPT-5 — Rogo announced that GPT-5 is integrated into its response engine and improves answer quality across complex financial reasoning tasks. �
Rogo
Google DeepMind’s Gemini 3 Pro — Rogo also supports the Gemini 3 Pro model, which is designed for advanced reasoning and multimodal capabilities. �
Rogo
🔹 Customization for Finance
Fine-tuned and custom models: In addition to these base LLMs, Rogo fine-tunes models on professionally labeled financial data to enhance precision for use cases like valuation analysis, pitch deck generation, and financial research. �

Their architecture is model-agnostic, meaning they can switch between or combine different underlying LLMs depending on the task and performance requirements. �

📌 Summary
So while Rogo doesn’t rely on a single proprietary LLM from scratch, its AI platform leverages top-tier models such as GPT-5 and Gemini 3 Pro, enhanced and fine-tuned for enterprise finance applications.

Workflow Automation and Output Generation
Rogo does more than generate text — it automates real financial workflows:
Prompt library & Quick Actions: Predefined, validated prompts automate common tasks (e.g., comps, memos, briefs). �
Rogo
Integrations with PowerPoint, Excel, Word: Outputs are returned in native formats, not just text blocks. �
Sacra
It can parse and edit complex spreadsheet models, explain assumptions, or update comps directly in Excel. �
Sacra
These workflows combine LLM reasoning + structured data interpretation + output templating.
Technically, this likely involves orchestration layers and task agents that break down prompts into multi-step processes (e.g., extract → analyze → format).
