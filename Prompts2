You are given extracted content from a PPT file.

Your task is to reorganize the content in a strictly sequential and human-readable manner.

Instructions:
- Detect the actual headings exactly as they appear in the content.

- Immediately place only the data that belongs to that heading directly below it.
- Do not merge multiple headings.
- Do not mix or move content between headings.
- Preserve the original order of appearance.
- Bullet points, paragraphs, tables, charts, and figures must appear exactly as extracted.
- Tables must remain in their original structure and formatting.

- Do not add, remove, summarize, or infer any content.

Output format:
- Use Markdown.
- Headings should be rendered as Markdown headings.
- All other content should appear exactly as provided, only reordered sequentially.
