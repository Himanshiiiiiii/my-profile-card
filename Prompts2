You are given extracted content from a PPT file.

Your task is to reorganize the content in a strictly sequential and human-readable manner.

Instructions:
- Detect the actual headings exactly as they appear in the content.
- Display each heading as-is (do not rename, number, or label them).
- Immediately place only the data that belongs to that heading directly below it.
- Do not merge multiple headings.
- Do not mix or move content between headings.
- Preserve the original order of appearance.
- Bullet points, paragraphs, tables, charts, and figures must appear exactly as extracted.
- Tables must remain in their original structure and formatting.
- If charts or graphs are present, include their descriptions exactly where they appear under the correct heading.
- Do not add, remove, summarize, or infer any content.

Output format:
- Use Markdown.
- Headings should be rendered as Markdown headings.
- All other content should appear exactly as provided, only reordered sequentially.

Now process the following content

prompt = """
You are given extracted content from a PPT file. The content may be scattered, out of order, or separated from the heading it logically belongs to.

Your task is to reorganize the content so that each heading is followed by all and only the data that logically belongs to it.

Instructions:
- Identify the actual headings exactly as they appear in the content.
- Display each heading as-is, without renaming, numbering, or modifying it.
- For each heading, gather all related content even if it appears elsewhere in the extracted text.
- Determine relationship based on semantic meaning, not proximity alone.
- Do not mix content between different headings.
- Do not merge multiple headings.
- Preserve the original text of bullet points, paragraphs, tables, and figures.
- Tables must appear exactly as extracted, without restructuring or summarization.
- Charts and graphs should be placed under the heading they describe.
- If the same data fragment clearly belongs to only one heading, place it there even if it was extracted earlier or later.
- Do not invent, infer, summarize, or omit any content.

Output format:
- Use Markdown.
- Render headings as Markdown headings using their original text.
- Place all corresponding content immediately under its heading.
- Do not include commentary, explanations, or labels.

Now reorganize the following content accordingly
